                              the Tatsu were guardians of traditions that dated back millennials. 
                              nestled within the folds of the sacred mountain named “tobirama”, 
                              they were the last vestiges of an ancient civilization that stood 
                              as a testament to the enduring spirit of humanity. Their village, 
                              protected by the mountain's treacherous terrain, remained concealed 
                              from the prying eyes of technology and the modern world. The tatsu  
                              are said to be descendants of the dragons.

                              of all things, the Tatsu are deeply spiritual. they abide by the teachings of 
                              the dragon – a symbol of strength, wisdom, and resilience. For them, the dragon 
                              is not just a mythical creature but a representation of the life force that binds 
                              every living being.

                            <p class="paragraphs">Shunning most modern conveniences, the tatsu are masters 
                              of the old ways. Their homes are built from materials found on the sacred mountain, 
                              and they cultivate the land for sustenance. Through rigorous training, discipline, 
                              and meditation, they become legendary samurais, mastering both the martial arts and 
                              the art of governance with a gentle yet firm hand.

                            <h3 class="titles"><br/>RELATION TO THE WORLD:</h3> 
                            <p class="paragraphs">With the world in chaos below, many have sought refuge in legends, 
                              and tales of the dragon-riding samurais of the sacred mountain spread far and wide. While 
                              the Tatsu traditionally kept to themselves, the changing world has made it harder for them 
                              to remain completely isolated. they have sometimes acted as mediators between warring factions, 
                              their reputation affording them a respect few could claim. However, they've been cautious of the 
                              citadel and its advances, viewing its existence as a sign of the world's imbalance.

                            <p class="paragraphs">In battle, a Tatsu samurai is a force to be reckoned with. Their combat 
                              style is fluid, drawing inspiration from the movements of the dragon, making it unpredictable and 
                              deadly. Their swords, forged from the rare minerals of the sacred mountain, are said to possess 
                              the spirit of the dragon, making them exceptionally durable and sharp. Most of the tatsu use an 
                              ancient energy called “ryūsei” that gives them unparalleled physical abilities and commanding the 
                              elements, this energy is also said to transform their bodies but it is only a legend.

                            <p class="paragraphs">While most of the Tatsu remain largely neutral, with the exception of those
                            already living on the iron city, their wisdom and combat skills are sought after. rumors abound that
                            they possess an ancient relic with the power to bring harmony back to the world, making them a 
                            potential ally, or threat, to any faction. As whispers of a new rebellion grow louder, many wonder 
                            if the time has come for the tatsu to descend from their sacred sanctuary and play a decisive role 
                            in the fate of the world.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
